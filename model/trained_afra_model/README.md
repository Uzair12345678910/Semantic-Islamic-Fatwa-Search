- source_sentence: Can telomeres prevent death?
  sentences:
  - 'Praise be to Allah.The most that can be said about telomeres, if it is true and
    proven scientifically, is that they work to renew nerve cells and prevent the
    cells aging; they reduce the speed of telomere loss, and thus increase the rate
    of cell renewal even in old age.

    Even if this is proven scientifically, it means that youthfulness is preserved
    and aging is avoided.

    But that has nothing to do with preventing death, because death happens to young
    and old, strong and weak; it is something that Allah has decreed for all humans
    and jinn.

    Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):

    “And We did not grant to any man before you eternity [on earth]; so if you die
    - would they be eternal?

    Every soul will taste death. And We test you with evil and with good as trial;
    and to Us you will be returned”

    [al-Anbiyaa’ 21:34-35]

    “Indeed, you are to die, and indeed, they are to die”

    [az-Zumar 39:30].

    Al-Bukhaari (7383) and Muslim (2717) narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas that the Prophet
    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to say: “…I seek refuge in Your
    glory – there is no god but You Who will never die, but jinn and men die.”

    No matter what strength, youthfulness or good health a person attains, he has
    an appointed time that Allah, may He be exalted, has decreed for him, and he will
    inevitably taste death, then he will be resurrected for the reckoning and requital.

    Among the polytheists there are those who deny the resurrection and the requital,
    but there is no one who denies death, for it is the reality that is seen by all,
    and no one can ward it off.

    Renewing cells, or preventing them from advancing in age, will be of no avail
    to the human being when the time of his death comes. You see the sturdiest of
    people, the best in health, the most youthful of them, dying when Allah wills
    it, and no one can ward off death from him.

    “Then why, when the soul at death reaches the throat,

    And you are at that time looking on –

    And Our angels are nearer to him than you, but you do not see –

    Then why do you not, if you are not to be recompensed,

    Bring it back, if you should be truthful?”

    [al-Waaqi‘ah 56:83-87].

    Glory be to the One Who subjects His slaves to death, whilst He alone remains
    for eternity.

    “And He is the subjugator over His servants, and He sends over you guardian-angels
    until, when death comes to one of you, Our messengers take him, and they do not
    fail [in their duties].

    Then they His servants are returned to Allah, their true Lord. Unquestionably,
    His is the judgement, and He is the swiftest in calling to account”

    [al-An‘aam 6:61-62].

    We do not know of anyone who has claimed to discover a medicine or a means of
    preventing death. No one will ever be able to do that, even if he seeks the help
    of all the people on earth, for the One Who created man created death, and has
    decreed people’s lifespans, and He ordained that in a Book with Him fifty thousand
    years before He created the heavens and the earth. None can put back His decree
    or overturn His decision.

    So forget about dubious matters; focus on yourself and prepare to meet Allah,
    may He be exalted, for the appointed time decreed by Allah is surely coming.

    And Allah knows best.'
  - 'Praise be to Allah.If you spoke about your friend out of fear for her and hoping
    to save her, then there is no sin on you, but you should have waited and should
    not have been so hasty. You do not have to offer kafaarah or do anything else,
    unless you got carried away in speaking about her and said something about her
    that she dislikes, in which case you should tell her and seek her forgiveness
    for backbiting about her. If she has heard what you said about her, then you have
    to apologize to her and ask her to forgive you. If she did not hear of what you
    said about her, then do not tell her, rather make a lot of du’aa’ for her, pray
    for forgiveness, and speak well of her and mention her good points to those to
    whom you spoke about her. We ask Allah to forgive us and you. 

    See also the answer to question no. 6308. 

    With regard to the problem of your brother’s doubts about your behaviour, this
    may be solved by asking Allah to guide him and to make him stop that. Then you
    should adhere to Allah’s command of hijab, lowering the gaze, and avoiding non-mahram
    men. Do a lot of naafil prayers and fasts, and give in charity. Try to speak to
    him frankly and warn him against being suspicious of you. 

    Undoubtedly if your brother sees that you are righteous he will no longer doubt
    you, and that suspicion will disappear from his heart, in sha Allah. 

    And Allah knows best.'
  - 'Praise be to Allah.Order of verses in one Surah

    The fact there is scholarly consensus, and many texts stating the order of verses
    in one Surah, that is very well known. The consensus was reported by many scholars,
    including Al-Zarkashi in al-Burhan and Abu Ja’far, who said: “The order of the
    verses in their Surahs came about because this is how it was instituted by the
    Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and there is no dispute among
    the Muslims with regard to this matter.”

    The texts regarding this matter include the following:


    The report narrated by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, al-Nasai, Ibn Hibban and
    al-Hakim from Ibn `Abbas, who said: “I said to ‘Uthman, ‘What made you put al-Anfal
    which is one of the Mathani, next to Bara-ah [al-Tawbah], which is one of the
    Mi’in? Why did you not put the line Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim in between them
    when you put it at the beginning of the rest of al-Sab’ al-Tiwal [the long seven
    Surahs]?” ‘Uthman said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah
    be upon him) used to receive revelation of Surahs with many verses. When they
    were revealed, he would call his scribes and tell them, ‘Put these verses in the
    Surah where such-and-such is mentioned.’ Al-Anfal was one of the first Surahs
    to be revealed in Madinah, and Bara-ah (al-Tawbah) was one of the last parts of
    the Quran to be revealed. Its stories were similar to the stories mentioned in
    al-Anfal, so it was thought that it was part of it. The Messenger of Allah (peace
    and blessings of Allah be upon him) was taken [i.e., died] without explaining
    whether it was indeed part of it, so they were put next to one another, and the
    line Bismillahir Rahman ir’Rahim was not written between them, and it [al-Tawbah]
    was put among the Sab’ al-Tiwal [seven long Surahs].” (Al-Hakim said: its isnad
    is sahih, and al-Dhahabi agreed with him. Al-Mustadrak, 2/330)

    Ahmad narrated in al-Musnad (4/218) with a hasan isnad from ‘Uthman ibn Abi’l-‘As
    that he said: “I was sitting with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings
    of Allah be upon him) when he fixed his gaze on something, then lowered his gaze
    until he was almost looking at the ground, then he gazed at something. He said,
    ‘Jibril (peace be upon him) came to me and told me to put this verse in this place
    in this Surah: “Verily, Allâh enjoins Al-‘Adl (i.e. justice and worshipping none
    but Allâh Alone Islâmic Monotheism) and Al-Ihsân [i.e. to be patient in performing
    your duties to Allâh, totally for Allâh’s sake and in accordance with the Sunnah
    (legal ways) of the Prophet in a perfect manner], and giving (help) to kith and
    kin (i.e. all that Allâh has ordered you to give them, e.g., wealth, visiting,
    looking after them, or any other kind of help), and forbids Al-Fahshâ (i.e. all
    evil deeds, e.g. illegal sexual acts, disobedience of parents, polytheism, to
    tell lies, to give false witness, to kill a life without right), and Al-Munkar
    (i.e. all that is prohibited by Islâmic law: polytheism of every kind, disbelief
    and every kind of evil deeds), and Al-Baghy (i.e. all kinds of oppression). He
    admonishes you, that you may take heed.” [al-Nahl 16:90 – interpretation of the
    meaning].’”

    Al-Bukhari narrated in al-Sahih (no. 4536) that Ibn Abi Malikah said: “Ibn al-Zubayr
    said: ‘I said to ‘Uthman, “This verse that is in al-Baqarah (interpretation of
    the meaning), ‘And those of you who die and leave wives behind them … And those
    of you who die and leave behind wives should bequeath for their wives a year’s
    maintenance and residence without turning them out’ [al-Baqarah 2:234-240] has
    been abrogated by the other, so why are you writing it down?” He said, “Leave
    it as it is, my nephew, I will not change anything from its place.”’”

    Muslim narrated (no. 1617) that ‘Umar said: “I did not ask the Prophet (peace
    and blessings of Allah be upon him) about anything more than I asked him about
    al-Kalalah [those who die leaving neither ascendants nor descendents as heirs],
    until he poked me in the chest with his finger and said, “Is not ayat al-sayf
    at the end of Surat al-Nisa enough for you?”

    There are also the hadiths about the verses at the end of Surat al-Baqarah.

    Muslim narrated (no. 809) from Abu al-Darda that whoever memorizes the first ten
    verses of Surat al-Kahf will be protected from the Dajjal; according to another
    version, whoever recites the last ten verses will be protected.


    The Prophet’s recitation of various Surahs in the presence of his Companions indicates
    that the order of their verses is something that was instituted and commanded
    by him, and that the Companions did not put the verses in a different order from
    that in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite
    them. The reports to that effect reach the level of Mutawatir.

    Al-Qadi Abu Bakr said in al-Intisar: 

    “The order of the verses is something that is obligatory and binding. Jibril used
    to say (to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)), ‘Put such
    and such an verse in such and such a place.’”

    He also said:

     “What we think is that all of the Quran which Allah revealed and commanded that
    it should be written down, and which was not abrogated after being revealed, is
    that which is contained between the covers of the Mus-haf of ‘Uthman, and that
    there is nothing lacking or added to it. Its order is the same as that commanded
    by Allah, may He be exalted, and instituted by the Prophet (peace and blessings
    of Allah be upon him). Nobody has moved any verse backwards or forwards. The Ummah
    learned from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) the order
    of the verses of each Surah properly, just as they learned from him the correct
    pronunciation and recitation.”

    Al-Baghawi said in Sharh al-Sunnah: 

    “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to instruct
    his Companions and teach them what was revealed to him of the Quran in the order
    in which it appears in our Mus-hafs now, the order which Jibril taught him. When
    each verse was revealed, Jibril would tell him, this verse is to be written after
    such and such a verse in Surah such and such. Thus it is clear that the efforts
    of the Companions were limited solely to gathering the Quran in one place, not
    to arranging its order. The Quran is written on al-Lawh al-Mahfuz in this order,
    then Allah sent it down in its entirety to the first heaven, whence it was revealed
    in stages as it was needed, and the order in which it was revealed is not the
    order in which it is recited.”

    Order of Surahs in the Quran

    With regard to the order of Surahs, was this also instituted by the Prophet (peace
    and blessings of Allah be upon him), or was this the ijtihad of the Companions?
    With regard to this question, there were differences among the scholars. The majority
    of scholars, including Malik and al-Qadi Abu Bakr, according to one of his two
    opinions, favoured the second opinion.

    Ibn Faris said: 

    “There were two aspects to the compilation of the Quran. One was putting the Surahs
    in a certain order, such as putting al-Sab’ al-Tiwal (the seven long Surahs) first,
    and following them with the Mi’in, which is what the Companions did. The second
    aspect is the compilation of the verses within the Surahs. This was instituted
    by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who recited them as
    he was told to by Jibreel, on the command of his Lord. On this basis, the Salaf
    differed as to the order in which the Surahs should appear. Some of them put them
    in order of revelation, which was the mus-haf of ‘Ali, which started with Iqra
    (al-‘Alaq), then al-Muddaththir, then Nun (al-Qalam), then al-Muzzammil, and so
    on. The Mus-haf of Ibn Mas’ud started with al-Baqarah, then al-Nisa, then Al ‘Imran,
    with other major differences. The Mus-haf of Ubayy was similar.”

    Al-Karmani said in al-Burhan: the order of the Surahs as it is now is the same
    as that in al-Lawh al-Mahfuz which is with Allah. This is the order in which the
    Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to review the Surahs of
    the Quran he had received so far with Jibril each year. In the year in which he
    died, he reviewed it with him twice, and the last verses to be revealed were (interpretation
    of the meaning): ‘And be afraid of the Day when you shall be brought back to Allah…’
    [al-Baqarah 2:281]. Jibril commanded the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah
    be upon him) to put this between the verses dealing with riba and those dealing
    with loans.”

    Al-Zarkashi said in al-Burhan: “The difference between the two views is one of
    wording. Those who support the second view say that it was taught to them so that
    they could learn the reasons of Revelation and the sequence of the words. Hence
    Malik said that they compiled the Quran according to what they had heard from
    the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), as well as saying that
    the order of the Surahs was the product of their ijtihad. He said that the dispute
    boils down to one question which is: was this a verbal instruction of the Prophet
    (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), or were they merely referring to what
    he used to do, which would give them room for ijtihad.”

    Al-Bayhaqi said in al-Madkhil: “At the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings
    of Allah be upon him), the Surahs and verses of the Quran were in this order,
    except for al-Anfal and Bara-ah (al-Tawbah), as we see from the hadith of ‘Uthman
    referred to above.”

    Ibn ‘Atiyah said: “The order of many of the Surahs was known during the lifetime
    of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), such as the seven long
    Surahs, those that begin with Ha’-Mim, and al-Mufassal. With regard to the others,
    it may be the case that it was left for the Ummah to determine their order after
    he died.”

    Abu Ja’far said: “The reports support most of what Ibn ‘Atiyah said, and a little
    is left which is open to debate, such as the hadith, ‘Recite the two shining ones,
    al-Baqarah and Al ‘Imran.’” (Reported by Muslim, no. 804)

    Al-Bukhari narrated (no. 4739) that ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased
    with him) said: “Bani Israil (al-Isra), al-Kahf, Maryam, Ta-Ha and al-Anbiya,
    these are among the earliest and most beautiful Surahs and they are my treasures,”
    (meaning, these are among the earliest I recited).

    Abu Ja’far al-Nahhas al-Mukhtar said that the Surahs were compiled in this order
    from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) because
    of the hadith of Wathilah, “In place of the Tawrat I was given the seven long
    Surahs.” He said: “This hadith indicates that the order of the Quran was taken
    from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).

    Ibn Hajar said, “the fact that the Surahs, or most of them, are in a given order
    does not contradict the idea that this was instituted by the Prophet (peace and
    blessings of Allah be upon him). What proves that this was instituted by the Prophet
    (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the report narrated by Ahmad and
    Abu Dawud from Aws ibn Hudhayfah, who said: ‘We asked the Companions of the Messenger
    of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the morning, “How did you
    write down the Quran in chapters?” They said, “We wrote it down in chapters of
    six Surahs, five Surahs, seven Surahs, nine Surahs, eleven Surahs and thirteen
    Surahs, and the chapter of al-Mufassal, from Qaf until the end. This indicates
    that the order of the Surahs – as it appears in the Mus-haf now – existed at the
    time of the Messenger of Allah, or it is possible that what was known in order
    at that time was Hizb al-Mufassal specifically, which is not the case with the
    rest.”

  - 'Praise be to Allah.There is no such thing as the third eye, which they say is
    on the forehead, between the eyes. This is a concept that originally stems from
    idolatrous religions.

    See: https://bit.ly/3vnLwQY

    There is no mention in the Qur’an or Sunnah, or in the words of the Sahaabah or
    the leading scholars who came after them, of this so-called invisible eye.

    But there is insight (baseerah), intuition (faraasah) and inspiration (ilhaam),
    all of which cannot be acquired by one’s efforts; rather they are gifts from Allah
    to some of His slaves.

    With regard to insight, al-Jarjaani said in at-Ta‘reefaat (p. 46): Insight (baseerah)
    is an ability in the heart that is illuminated by divine light, by which a person
    may see the true nature of things and what lies beyond their physical appearance.
    It is similar to eyesight with which he sees the physical appearance of things.
    End quote.

    With regard to intuition (faraasah), Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him)
    said, discussing its cause, its true nature and its origin:

    It is light that Allah shines into the heart of His slave, by means of which he
    distinguishes between truth and falsehood, good and bad, the one who tells the
    truth and the one who tells lies.

    Its true nature is that it is an idea that springs to mind and rules out its opposite;
    it overwhelms the heart like a lion overwhelms the prey.… This intuition is commensurate
    with the strength of the person’s faith: whoever is stronger in faith, his intuition
    will be sharper.

    The origin of this type of intuition is life and light that Allah, may He be exalted,
    grants to whomever He wills of His slaves, and the heart is revived and illuminated
    by that, so that his intuition is hardly ever wrong. Allah says (interpretation
    of the meaning):

    {And is one who was dead and We gave him life and made for him light by which
    to walk among the people like one who is in darkness, never to emerge therefrom?} [al-An‘aam
    6:122].

    His heart was deadened by disbelief and ignorance, then Allah revived it with
    faith and knowledge, and through the Qur’an and faith, He gave him light by means
    of which he finds the appropriate way of dealing with people, and finds his way
    in the darkness. And Allah knows best." (Madaarij as-Saalikeen  2/483-486).

    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Allah,
    may He be glorified and exalted, gives to many people knowledge through intuition,
    by means of which they may learn about a person’s circumstances and character,
    by looking at his facial features and eyes, and also some of what he says, as
    Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):

    {but you will surely know them by the tone of [their] speech} [Muhammad 47:30].

    \n    1 – It is not permissible to abort the pregnancy at various \n    stages\

  - 'Praise be to Allah.We have previously explained several times on our site that
    some kinds of cosmetic surgery are permissible, namely that which is done to treat
    a fault, remove a deformity and so on, and some kinds are haraam and are not allowed,
    namely that which is done solely for the purpose of beautification. 

    Please see the answer to questions no. 47694 and 108860. 

    So long as the surgery that you are going to do is to remove a fault that resulted
    from losing weight, there is nothing wrong with that if it will not result in
    harm that is greater than the harm occurring right now. 

    The scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas were asked:

    One of my friends got married by the help of Allah. He came to me and said: e
    came to me and said that his wife wants to have cosmetic surgery on her face and
    breasts, because her nose is large and wide, and she wants to reduce it by means
    of the easy methods that modern science has developed. Is there any doubt about
    this surgery or is there any sin involved? Please note that not doing it may lead
    to psychological distress because this fault appears so prominently on her face. 

    They replied: If the situation is as described, and there is the hope that the
    surgery will be successful and will not lead to a greater or equal harm, then
    it is permissible to do it in order to achieve the desired purpose, otherwise
    it is not permissible. 

    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 25/59-60 

    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: 

    What is the Islamic ruling on having surgery to remove physical defects that may
    occur in people whether as a result of sickness or an accident, or that had been
    present since birth, such as removing extra digits and repairing the hand to make
    it look natural, or removing extra teeth and straightening the rest of the teeth
    so that the mouth will go back to normal, or correcting a harelip and making it
    look normal, or removing scars caused by burning, straightening a crooked nose
    or reducing its size in order to facilitate breathing, or completing a defective
    ear, or tightening drooping eyelids because they block one’s vision, or tightening
    sagging skin on the face so that the face will look more natural, or breast reduction
    for women in cases where large breasts are causing spinal problems because of
    their weight, or tummy tucks in the case of a sagging belly and weak abdominal
    muscles which lead to hernias, straightening the urethra in males in cases where
    urine is contaminating the clothing, removing deformed spots from the face, and
    removal of fat in obese individuals which may cause many diseases such as diabetes,
    high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels. Please note that these operations
    will not cause any deformity, in sha Allah. 

    He replied: 

    There is nothing wrong with treating the problems mentioned with remedies that
    are prescribed in sharee‘ah or with permissible remedies from specialist doctors
    who think it most likely that the treatment will be successful, because of the
    general meaning of the shar‘i evidence which says that it is permissible to treat
    diseases and illnesses with acceptable or permissible remedies. End quote.

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: 

    What is the ruling on cosmetic surgery that is done by women? 

    He replied:

    If it is done to remove a fault, there is nothing wrong with it so long as it
    does not cause any harm, because ‘Arfajah (may Allah be pleased with him) wore
    a nose made of gold when his nose was cut off. One example is tightening or lifting
    drooping breasts. End quote.

  - "Praise be to Allah.\n    \n    Firstly: \n\n    The \n    scholars have divided\
    \ knowledge of the stars into two categories: \n\n    1.Astronomy \n\n    this\
    \ \n    refers to knowledge of the names of stars, when and where they rise and\
    \ set, \n    and how they may be used for the purposes of measuring time and for\
    \ \n    navigation, and other visible things which observation and experience\
    \ have \n    proven what each star could be used for (working out directions,\
    \ measuring \n    the passage of time and so on). \n\n    There \n    is nothing\
    \ wrong with learning and teaching this type of knowledge, and \n    there is\
    \ no evidence to suggest that it is forbidden or makrooh to study it. \n    In\
    \ fact, in the Holy Qur’an there is evidence to suggest that it is \n    permissible\
    \ and this knowledge is a blessing that Allah, may He be glorified \n    and exalted,\
    \ has bestowed upon people, as Allah, may He be glorified and \n    exalted, says\
    \ (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n    “It is He Who has set the stars \n \
    \   for you, so that you may guide your course with their help through the \n\
    \    darkness of the land and the sea. We have (indeed) explained in detail Our\
    \ \n    Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, Revelations, etc.) for\
    \ \n    people who know”\n\n    \n    [al-An‘aam 6:97]\n\n    “It is He Who made\
    \ the sun a \n    shining thing and the moon as a light and measured out its (their)\
    \ stages, \n    that you might know the number of years and the reckoning. Allah\
    \ did not \n    create this but in truth. He explains the Ayat (proofs, evidences,\
    \ verses, \n    lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) in detail for people who have\
    \ knowledge”\n\n    \n    [Yoonus 10:5]. \n\n    2.Astrology\n\n    this \n  \
    \  refers to interpreting the locations and movements of the stars and the  \n\
    \    (supposed) influence they have on worldly developments and events such as\
    \ \n    death, birth, epidemics, disasters, attaining happiness and other matters\
    \ \n    for which there is no rational, empirical basis for connecting these \n\
    \    developments to the movements of heavenly bodies. Rather this is mere \n\
    \    conjecture and speculation for which there is no proof or evidence. \n\n\
    \    This \n    is what the shar‘i evidence definitively forbids; it is haraam\
    \ to learn it, \n    teach it or study it. \n\n    Shaykh \n    al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah\
    \ (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n    The \n    craft of astrology which\
    \ seeks to establish the influence and impact of \n    heavenly bodies, and to\
    \ find out about future earthly events or developments \n    on the basis of celestial\
    \ events, and to make a connection between celestial \n    movements and earthly\
    \ influence, is a prohibited craft according to the \n    Qur’an and Sunnah, and\
    \ the consensus of the ummah. In fact it is forbidden \n    by all the Messengers\
    \ to their communities.\n\n    Allah, \n    may He be exalted, says (interpretation\
    \ of the meaning):\n\n    “and the magician will never be \n    successful, no\
    \ matter whatever amount (of skill) he may attain”\n    \n\n    \n    [Ta-Ha 20:69]\n\
    \n    “Have \n    you not seen those who were given a portion of the Scripture?\
    \ They believe \n    in Jibt [sorcery] and Taghoot [evil]”\n\n    \n    [an-Nisa’\
    \ 4:51].\n\n    ‘Umar \n    and others said that Jibt (sorcery) refers to magic\
    \ or witchcraft. \n\n    Abu \n    Dawood narrated in his Sunan with a hasan isnaad\
    \ from Qubaysah ibn \n    Mukhaariq that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah\
    \ be upon him) said: \n    “Augury (observing omens in birds etc.), superstition\
    \ and geomancy come \n    under the heading of jibt (magic).” \n\n    If \n  \
    \  geomancy, which is akin to astrology, comes under the heading of jibt \n  \
    \  (magic), then how about astrology itself? That is because in geomancy they\
    \ \n    refer to shapes on earth, because astrology is based on shapes in the\
    \ \n    heavens.\n\n    \n     Ahmad, Abu Dawood, Ibn Maajah and others narrated\
    \ with a saheeh isnaad from \n    Ibn ‘Abbaas that he said: “Whoever learns astrology\
    \ learns a branch of \n    magic; the more he learns (of the former) the more\
    \ he learns (of the \n    latter).” The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace\
    \ of Allah be upon him) \n    clearly stated that astrology comes under the same\
    \ heading as magic. Allah, \n    may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the\
    \ meaning):\n\n    “and the magician will never be \n    successful, no matter\
    \ whatever amount (of skill) he may attain”\n    \n\n    \n    [Ta-Ha 20:69].\n\
    \n    And \n    this is how it really is. From studying the situation of astrologers,\
    \ we see \n    that they never prosper either in this world or in the hereafter. \n\
    \n    Ahmad, \n    and Muslim in his Saheeh, narrated from Safiyyah bint ‘Ubayd,\
    \ from \n    one of the wives of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be\
    \ upon him), \n    from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)\
    \ that he said: \n    “Whoever goes to a fortune teller and asks him about something,\
    \ no prayer \n    will be accepted from him for forty days.” The astrologer is\
    \ the same as the \n    fortune teller according to some of the scholars; according\
    \ to others he \n    comes under the same category. If this is the case with regard\
    \ to the one \n    who asks, then how about the one who is asked? \n\n    He \n\
    \    also narrated in his Saheeh that Mu‘aawiyah ibn al-Hakam as-Sulami \n   \
    \ said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, there are some men among us who go to \n\
    \    soothsayers. He said: “Do not go to them.” \n\n    The \n    Prophet (blessings\
    \ and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade going to \n    soothsayers, and astrologers\
    \ are the same as soothsayers according to \n    al-Khattaabi and other scholars,\
    \ and this was also narrated from the Arabs. \n    According to others, they come\
    \ under the same category as soothsayers and \n    are worse than them. \n\n \
    \   More \n    than one of the scholars has narrated that there is consensus on\
    \ the \n    prohibition of astrology, such as al-Baghawi, al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad and\
    \ others. \n\n    In \n    as-Saheehayn it is narrated from Zayd ibn Khaalid al-Juhani\
    \ that he \n    said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be\
    \ upon him) led \n    us in praying Fajr at al-Hudaybiyah, after it had rained\
    \ at night. When he \n    finished, he turned to the people and said: “Do you\
    \ know what your Lord \n    said?” They said: Allah and His Messenger know best.\
    \ He said: “He said: \n    ‘This morning some of My slaves believe in Me and some\
    \ disbelieve. As for \n    the one who said, we got rain by the bounty and mercy\
    \ of Allah, he is a \n    believer in Me and a disbeliever in the stars. But as\
    \ for the one who said, \n    We got rain by virtue of such and such a star, he\
    \ is a disbeliever in Me and \n    a believer in the stars.’” \n\n    \n    Leading\
    \ astrologers of the earlier and later generations have admitted that \n    in\
    \ the case of the believers who worship Allah and turn to Him in \n    supplication,\
    \ Allah removed from them – by virtue of the blessing of their \n    worship,\
    \ supplication and trust in Allah – that which the astrologers said \n    on the\
    \ basis of their astrological calculations would inevitably befall \n    them.\
    \ They have also admitted that those who worship Allah, call upon Him \n    and\
    \ put their trust in Him will be given reward in this world and in the \n    hereafter\
    \ that no astrological power could ever bring them. \nWho has made the best of\
    \ this world and the Hereafter in \n    following the Messengers, and has made\
    \ the best nation those who enjoin what \n    is good and forbid what is evil.\
    \ \n    \n    End \n    quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa, 35/192-196 \n\n    \n \
    \   Secondly: \n\n    \n    However, we do not deny that some of what the astrologer\
    \ says about future \n    events may sometimes be correct and may sometimes happen\
    \ as he foretold; but \n    that does not mean that the path he is following is\
    \ valid. Rather what he \n    happens to get right is baseless and comes about\
    \ by pure coincidence. What \n    he gets right is very little in comparison to\
    \ the lies that accompany it. \n\n    Do you \n    not see that the Prophet (blessings\
    \ and peace of Allah be upon him) has told \n    us that the jinn who eavesdrop\
    \ (on the angels) may hear something of what \n    the angels talk about of future\
    \ events, and the jinni may send down what he \n    has heard to the soothsayer\
    \ on earth, or the jinni may be burned before he \n    can do that? Yet despite\
    \ that, soothsaying is a major sin, because it deals \n    with matters of the\
    \ unseen without any shar‘i basis. \n\n    It was \n    narrated from ‘Aa’ishah\
    \ (may Allah be pleased with her), the wife of the \n    Prophet (blessings and\
    \ peace of Allah be upon him) that she heard the \n    Messenger of Allah (blessings\
    \ and peace of Allah be upon him) say: \n\n    “The \n    angels come down in\
    \ the clouds and discuss matters that have been decreed in \n    heaven, and the\
    \ devils may eavesdrop and hear it, then they convey it to the \n    soothsayers,\
    \ and they tell along with it one hundred lies that they have \n    fabricated\
    \ by themselves.”\n\n    \n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 3210 \n\n    Hence\
    \ \n    al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n    Allah \n \
    \   may create in this type – meaning the astrologers – some kind of power, but\
    \ \n    their lies are what predominates. End quote. \n\n    Quoted \n    from\
    \ Sharh an-Nawawi ‘ala Muslim, 14/223 \n\n    Shaykh \n    Ibn Baaz (may Allah\
    \ have mercy on him) said: \n\n    It may \n    so happen that the divine decree\
    \ is in accordance with a person’s need, so \n    the poor man thinks that it\
    \ is because of this astrologer, or because of \n    this soothsayer, that this\
    \ thing happened. Or it may be that a person \n    prescribes a regular remedy\
    \ other than what the astrologer claims, and that \n    the person who prescribes\
    \ it knows that it is good for this sickness, but \n    the sick person thinks\
    \ that healing comes about only because of the \n    astrologers looking at the\
    \ stars, and so on. The point is that if healing \n    occurs sometimes after\
    \ going to soothsayers or astrologers or geomancers and \n    their ilk, that\
    \ does not prove that their way is sound. The mushrikeen \n    themselves – who\
    \ worship idols – may come to an idol and ask of it, then \n    what they wanted\
    \ happens by Allah’s leave, as a coincidence and for reasons \n    known to Allah\
    \ in His wisdom, or it may come about by means of the devils, \n    and thus becomes\
    \ a trial and test. But it does not come from the idol, \n    because the idol\
    \ did not do anything, and the jinni who is with him did not \n    do anything.\
    \ Rather the divine decree may dictate that this sickness should \n    go away\
    \ or this calamity should be alleviated after this poor man went to \n    the\
    \ idol and asked of it or offered a sacrifice to it. Thus that comes about \n\
    \    as a test and trial in itself, without that being the result of any action\
    \ \n    on the part of the magician, the idol, the jinn and so on. This made the\
    \ \n    mushrikeen even more attached to their idols, and thus they worshipped\
    \ them \n    instead of Allah. \n\n    The \n    wise person should never be deceived\
    \ by what happens at the hands of these \n    astrologers, soothsayers, fortune\
    \ tellers or magicians; rather he must keep \n    away from them and not believe\
    \ in them. \n\n    End \n    quote from Majmoo‘ Fataawa Ibn Baaz, 8/89-90 \n\n\
    \    \n    Thirdly: \n\n    Once \n    the above is clearly understood, there\
    \ will be no confusion from a \n    scientific or shar‘i point of view about the\
    \ story of the astrologers at the \n    time of Nimrood and Ibraaheem (peace be\
    \ upon him), if the story is even \n    sound in the first place. It is not unlikely\
    \ that the words of the \n    astrologers may have turned out to be correct, although\
    \ lies are more \n    prevalent in their case and the type of knowledge they have\
    \ is corrupt. \n\n    Yet we \n    should point out that the story is not proven\
    \ with any saheeh isnaad; rather \n    it was narrated by some of the historians\
    \ as just a story with no real \n    proof. \n\n    See:\n    al-Bidaayah wa’n-Nihaayah\
    \ by Ibn Katheer, 1/200 \n\n    And \n    Allah knows best."
  - "Praise be to Allah.This manner \n    of treating your son is very strange. There\
    \ follows some advice, perhaps \n    Allaah will cause you to benefit from it:\
    \  \n1 – A small \n    child needs food, drink, sleep and air, and love and compassion\
    \ are among \n    the best kinds of food that the parents can give their child.\
    \ Giving \n    physical food without this emotional nourishment is neglect of\
    \ the child’s \n    natural need for both. \n2 – Showing \n    compassion to the\
    \ child brings positive results. Hence we are advised to \n    breastfeed the\
    \ child naturally so that the goodness of food and drink will \n    be combined\
    \ with the goodness of being in the proper place, which is his \n    mother’s\
    \ lap. Hence modern science has discovered the great effects that \n    mother’s\
    \ milk has on the physical and emotional development of the child and \n    –\
    \ conversely – the negative effects of depriving the child of his mother’s \n\
    \    milk and care. Societies in which violence towards children is widespread\
    \ \n    have become societies in which crime and evildoing has become widespread. \n\
    Some \n    sociologists have stated that the parent’s ongoing smacking and rebuking\
    \ of \n    their children leads to psychological complexes in the child and increases\
    \ \n    family violence. This leads to a problem which is difficult to confront,\
    \ \n    because violence in the home leads to violence in society, which becomes\
    \ \n    widespread, and the victims of this violence in turn inflict psychological\
    \ \n    terrorism on individuals, which threatens the security of the society. \n\
    3 – The one \n    who is harsh towards his children is going against sound human\
    \ nature \n    (fitrah) and sharee’ah (Islamic law). Allaah has created people\
    \ with love for their children. Hence Allaah and His Messenger  (peace and blessings\
    \ of Allaah \n    be upon him) did not enjoin parents to care for their children\
    \ in this \n    manner (because it is innate). On the contrary, Islam enjoins\
    \ children to \n    care for their fathers and mothers, and warns them against\
    \ disobeying them. \nAs for going \n    against sharee’ah: smacking children and\
    \ not showing compassion towards them \n    is indicative of a lack of mercy in\
    \ the heart of the one who does that, \n    which is a sign of being deprived\
    \ of the mercy of Allaah, may He be \n    exalted. \nIt was \n    narrated that\
    \ Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The \n    Messenger of Allaah\
    \  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) kissed \n    al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali\
    \ when al-Aqra’ ibn Haabis al-Tameemi was sitting with him. \n    Al-Aqra’ said:\
    \ I have ten children and I have never kissed one of them. The \n    Messenger\
    \ of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \n    “The one\
    \ who does not show mercy will not be shown mercy.” \nNarrated by \n    al-Bukhaari\
    \ (5651) and Muslim (2318). \nIt was \n    narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah\
    \ be pleased with her) said: A Bedouin \n    came to the Prophet  (peace and blessings\
    \ of Allaah be upon him) and \n    said: Do you kiss children? We do not kiss\
    \ them. The Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “What\
    \ can I do for you if Allaah has \n    removed mercy from your heart?” Narrated\
    \ by al-Bukhaari (5652). \nOur \n    Prophet’s compassion towards children was\
    \ so great that he would shorten the \n    prayer because of their crying, out\
    \ of compassion towards them and their \n    mothers. \nIt was \n    narrated\
    \ from Anas ibn Maalik that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah\
    \ be upon him) said: “I start to pray intending to make it long, then I \n   \
    \ hear the crying of a child, so I make it short because of his mother’s \n  \
    \  distress.” \nNarrated by \n    al-Bukhaari (677) and Muslim (470). \n4 – You\
    \ \n    should understand that you are falling short in raising your child by\
    \ doing \n    this, and you may see the evil consequences of it in this world\
    \ before the \n    Hereafter. How can such treatment produce a good upbringing\
    \ and a sound, \n    righteous child? \n5 – You \n    should understand that a\
    \ child’s crying does not happen for no reason, \n    rather every kind of crying\
    \ has its cause. So you should feel compassion \n    towards him when he is crying,\
    \ so that you will be motivated to find the \n    cause, such as sickness or hunger.\
    \ You should not be quick to smack him or \n    pinch him or mistreat him, lest\
    \ you add another reason, which is crying \n    because of pain. \nA \n    psychologist\
    \ said: Psychologists think that crying, like other behaviour, is \n    usually\
    \ a means of relieving tension. So crying, screaming, yelling, \n    breaking\
    \ toys and possessions and fidgeting are all ways of expressing \n    tension\
    \ that is connected to anger or grief, because the frustration that \n    the\
    \ child is faced with may create aggressiveness in him, so crying is a way \n\
    \    to expressing this aggression and getting rid of it. Not crying may be \n\
    \    indicative of suppression of this aggression, which may then move to the\
    \ \n    subconscious where the child may forget it, but it will not be hidden\
    \ \n    completely and it may manifest itself when he grows older in the form\
    \ of \n    sickness, anxiety, and aggression whenever the child finds an opportunity. \n\
    6 – You \n    should also note that shaking a child may cause mental or physical\
    \ \n    disability, so how about if he is smacked? \nAmerican \n    researchers\
    \ have warned that shaking children may cause death or severe \n    mental disability.\
    \ Researchers have explained that destruction of the brain \n    may occur when\
    \ a child is shaken violently. It may cause them to die or may \n    cause nerve\
    \ damage and mental disability, such as learning disabilities, \n    mental paralysis,\
    \ blindness, convulsions, difficulty in reading, attention \n    deficit disorder\
    \ and other educational problems. \nOne female \n    specialist said: Infants’\
    \ crying is annoying and disturbing, but it is their \n    only way to express\
    \ their needs, so first of all we need to find out the \n    reason why the infant\
    \ is crying and hasten to tend to it, instead of shaking \n    him. She emphasized\
    \ that boys are more likely to be harmed than girls, as \n    57% of victims are\
    \ male. \nResearchers \n    noted that shaking a child violently when he cries\
    \ or throwing him up in the \n    air and catching him, or shaking him violently\
    \ on one's knees or jogging \n    with him are all factors that may lead to brain\
    \ damage, as the result of the \n    brain being knocked against the skull, which\
    \ causes blood vessels to break \n    and leads to haemorrhaging in the brain.\
    \ Experts have pointed out that \n    nursing infants and newborns are the most\
    \ likely to suffer disability \n    resulting from shaking, in comparison to older\
    \ children. \nConclusion: \n    You have to fear Allaah and not go against the\
    \ fitrah (sound human nature) \n    or the laws of Allaah. You should be compassionate\
    \ towards your beautiful \n    child and do not cause him to be lost or disabled,\
    \ then you would have to \n    live your whole life with this mistake. Look at\
    \ the life of the Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and\
    \ his companions, and let them \n    be a good example for you.  \nStrive to \n\
    \    make du’aa’ (supplication) and recite ruqyah (incantations) for yourself,\
    \ your family and your child, lest you be afflicted by the evil eye or witchcraft.\
    \ Ruqyah is beneficial in all cases.  \nWe hope that \n    you will be guided\
    \ aright and that your child will be safe from harm. We ask Allaah to help you\
    \ to raise him soundly. \nAnd Allaah knows best."
  - "Praise be to Allah.\n    The hadeeth which the questioner is referring to is\
    \ a lengthy \n    hadeeth about the story of how the great Sahaabi Salmaan al-Faarisi\
    \ (may \n    Allaah be pleased with him) came to Islam.  He was a Magian (Zoroastrian),\
    \ \n    then he became a Christian, then he became a Muslim. That was after he\
    \ had \n    met a number of Christian monks, the last of whom was a righteous\
    \ man who \n    had knowledge of the last Prophet. The monk advised Salmaan to\
    \ go to Arabia, \n    where the last Prophet would appear, and he described the\
    \ place to him, and \n    it was the City of the Prophet  (peace and blessings\
    \ of Allaah be upon \n    him) i.e., Madeenah. But there is nothing in this hadeeth\
    \ to suggest that \n    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)\
    \ said that this \n    monk was the Messiah ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (peace be upon him),\
    \ rather ‘Eesa \n    (peace be upon him) is in heaven; Allaah took him up and\
    \ he will remain \n    there until the appointed time, then Allaah will send him\
    \ back down and he \n    will support Islam at the end of time. \n\n    The story\
    \ of how Salmaan came to Islam is a great story, full \n    of lessons and exhortations.\
    \ We will let the questioner read the hadeeth in \n    full, so that he might\
    \ benefit from it: \n\n    It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abbaas said:\
    \ Salmaan \n    al-Faarisi told me his story from his own lips. He said: \n\n\
    \    I was a Persian man, one of the people of Isbahaan, from a \n    village\
    \ thereof called Jayy. My father was the chieftain of his village, and \n    I\
    \ was the dearest of Allaah’s creation to him. He loved me so much that he \n\
    \    kept me in his house near the fire, as girls are kept in. I strove hard in\
    \ \n    the Magian religion until I became the keeper of the fire, which I tended\
    \ \n    and did not let go out for a moment. My father had a huge garden, and\
    \ he was \n    busy one day with some construction work, so he said: “O my son,\
    \ I am too \n    busy with this building today, go and check my garden,” and he\
    \ told me some \n    of the things he wanted done. I went out, heading towards\
    \ his garden, and I \n    passed by one of the Christian churches, where I could\
    \ hear their voices as \n    they were praying. I did not know anything about\
    \ the people because my \n    father had kept me in his house. When I passed by\
    \ and heard their voices, I \n    entered upon them to see what they were doing.\
    \ When I saw them, I was \n    impressed with their prayer and I was attracted\
    \ to their way. I said: By \n    Allaah, this is better than the religion that\
    \ we follow. By Allaah, I did \n    not leave them until the sun set, and I forgot\
    \ about my father’s garden and \n    did not go there. I said to them: Where did\
    \ this religion originate? They \n    said: In Syria. Then I went back to my father,\
    \ who had sent people out to \n    look for me, and I had distracted him from\
    \ all his work. When I came to him, \n    he said: O my son, where were you? Did\
    \ I not ask you to do what I asked? I \n    said: O my father, I passed by some\
    \ people who were praying in a church of \n    theirs, and I was impressed with\
    \ what I saw of their religion. By Allaah, I \n    stayed with them until the\
    \ sun set. He said: O my son, there is nothing good \n    in that religion. Your\
    \ religion and the religion of your forefathers is \n    better than that. I said:\
    \ No, by Allaah, it is better than our religion. He \n    was afraid for me, and\
    \ he put fetters on my legs and kept me in his house. I \n    sent word to the\
    \ Christians saying: If any Christian merchants come to you \n    from Syria,\
    \ tell me about them. He said: Some Christian merchants came to \n    them from\
    \ Syria, and they told me about them. I said to them: When they have \n    completed\
    \ their business and want to go back to their own country, tell me \n    about\
    \ that. So when they wanted to go back to their own country, they told \n    me\
    \ about that, and I threw off the irons from my legs and went out with \n    them,\
    \ until I came to Syria. When I reached Syria, I said: Who is the best \n    person\
    \ in this religion? They said: The bishop in the church.  So I went to \n    him\
    \ and said: I like this religion, and I would like to stay with you and \n   \
    \ serve you in your church and learn from you and pray with you. He said: Come\
    \ \n    in. So I went in with him, but he was a bad man. He would command them\
    \ and \n    exhort them to give charity, but he kept a great deal of it for himself\
    \ and \n    did not give it to the poor; he had amassed seven chests of gold and\
    \ silver. \n    I hated him deeply when I saw what he was doing, then he died\
    \ and the \n    Christians gathered to bury him. I said to them: This was a bad\
    \ man; he \n    commanded you and exhorted you to give charity, but when you brought\
    \ it to \n    him he kept it for himself and did not give any of it to the poor.\
    \ They \n    said: How do you know that? Show us where his treasure is. So I showed\
    \ them \n    where it was and they brought out seven chests filled with gold and\
    \ silver. \n    When they saw that they said: By Allaah, we will never bury him;\
    \ then they \n    crucified him and pelted him with stones.  Then they brought\
    \ another man and \n    appointed him in his place. Salmaan said: I have never\
    \ seen a man who does \n    not offer the five daily prayers who was better than\
    \ him; he shunned this \n    world and sought the Hereafter and no one strive\
    \ harder than him night and \n    day. I loved him as I had never loved anyone\
    \ before, and I stayed with him \n    for a while. Then when he was about to die,\
    \ I said: O So and so, I was with \n    you and I loved you as I had never loved\
    \ anyone before, and now the decree \n    of Allaah has come to you as you see;\
    \ to whom do you advise me to go? What \n    do you command me to do? He said:\
    \ O my son, by Allaah, I do not know of \n    anyone today who follows what I\
    \ followed. The people are doomed; they have \n    changed and abandoned most\
    \ of what they used to follow, except for a man in \n    Mosul. He is So and so,\
    \ and he follows what I used to follow, so go and join \n    him. When he died\
    \ and was buried, I went to the man in Mosul. I said to him: \n    O So and so,\
    \ So and so advised me when he died to come to you, and he told \n    me that\
    \ you follow the same as he followed. He said to me: Stay with me. So \n    I\
    \ stayed with him, and I found him to be a good man who followed the same as \n\
    \    his companion had followed. But soon he died. When he was dying I said to\
    \ \n    him: O So and so, So and so advised me to come to you and told me to join\
    \ \n    you, but now there has come to you from Allaah what you see. To whom do\
    \ you \n    advise me to go? What do you command me to do? He said: O my son,\
    \ by Allaah \n    I do not know of anyone who follows what we used to follow except\
    \ a man in \n    Nasayyibeen. He is So and so; go to him. When he died and was\
    \ buried, I went \n    to the man in Nasayyibeen. I came to him and told him my\
    \ story and what my \n    companion had told me to do. He said: Stay with me.\
    \ So I stayed with him and \n    I found him to be a follower of the same way\
    \ as his two companions, and I \n    stayed with a good man. By Allaah, soon death\
    \ came upon him, and when he was \n    dying I said to him: O So and so, So and\
    \ so advised me to go to So and so; \n    then So and so advised me to come to\
    \ you. To whom do you advise me to go and \n    what do you command me to do?\
    \ He said: O my son, by Allaah we do not know of \n    anyone left who follows\
    \ our way and to whom I can tell you to go, except a \n    man in ‘Ammooriyyah.\
    \ He follows something like what we follow. If you wish, \n    go to him, for\
    \ he follows our way. When he died and was buried, I went to \n    the man in\
    \ ‘Ammooriyyah and told him my story. He said: Stay with me. So I \n    stayed\
    \ with a man who was following the same way as his companions. I earned \n   \
    \ wealth until I had cows and sheep, then the decree of Allaah came to him. \n\
    \    When he was dying I said to him: O So and so, I was with So and so, and So\
    \ \n    and so told me to go to So and so; then So and so told me to go to So\
    \ and \n    so; then So and so told me to come to you. To whom do you advise me\
    \ to go \n    and what do you command me to do? He said: O my son, by Allaah,\
    \ I do not \n    know of anyone who follows our way to whom I can advise you to\
    \ go. But there \n    has come the time of a Prophet, who will be sent with the\
    \ religion of \n    Ibraaheem. He will appear in the land of the Arabs and will\
    \ migrate to a \n    land between two harrahs (lave fields; land with black rocks),\
    \ between which \n    there are palm trees. He will have characteristics that\
    \ will not be hidden. \n    He will eat of what is given as a gift but he will\
    \ not eat of what is given \n    as charity. Between his shoulder blades is the\
    \ Seal of Prophethood. If you \n    can go to that land then do so. Then he died\
    \ and was buried, and I stayed in \n    ‘Ammooriyyah as long as Allaah willed\
    \ I should stay, then some merchants of \n    Kalb passed by me and I said to\
    \ them: Will you take me to the land of the \n    Arabs and I will give you these\
    \ cows and sheep of mine? They said: Yes. So I \n    gave them the cows and sheep,\
    \ and they took me there, but when they brought \n    me to Waadi al-Qura they\
    \ wronged me and sold me as a slave to a Jewish man. \n    When I was with him\
    \ I saw the palm trees, and I hoped that this was the land \n    that my companion\
    \ had described to me, but I was not sure. Whilst I was with \n    him, a cousin\
    \ of his from Banu Qurayzah came to him from Madeenah, and he \n    sold me to\
    \ him, and he took me to Madeenah. By Allaah, as soon as I saw it, \n    I recognized\
    \ it from the description given to me by my companion.  I stayed \n    there,\
    \ and Allaah sent His Messenger, who stayed in Makkah as long as he \n    stayed,\
    \ and I did not hear anything about him because I was so busy with the \n    work\
    \ of a slave. Then he migrated to Madeenah, and by Allaah, I was at the \n   \
    \ top of a palm tree belonging to my master, doing some work on it, and my \n\
    \    master was sitting there. Then a cousin of his came and stood beside him,\
    \ \n    and said: May Allaah kill Banu Qaylah! By Allaah, right now they are \n\
    \    gathering in Quba’ to welcome a man who has come from Makkah today, and they\
    \ \n    say that he is a Prophet. When I heard that, I began to shiver so much\
    \ that \n    I thought I would fall on top of my master. I came down from the\
    \ tree and \n    started saying to that cousin of his: What are you saying, what\
    \ are you \n    saying? My master got angry and he struck me with his fist and\
    \ said: What \n    has it got to do with you? Go back to your work! I said: Nothing;\
    \ I just \n    wanted to make sure of what he was saying. I had something that\
    \ I had \n    collected, and when evening came, I went to the Messenger of Allaah\
    \  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he was in Quba’, and\
    \ I \n    entered upon him and said to him: I have heard that you are a righteous\
    \ man \n    and that you have companions who are strangers and are in need. This\
    \ is \n    something that I have to give in charity, and I see that you are more\
    \ in \n    need of it than anyone else. I brought it near to him and the Messenger\
    \ of \n    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to his \n\
    \    companions: “Eat,” but he refrained from eating.  I said to myself: This\
    \ is \n    one. Then I went away and collected some more. The Messenger of Allaah\
    \  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) moved to Madeenah, then I\
    \ came \n    to him and said: I see that you do not eat (food given in) charity;\
    \ this is \n    a gift with which I wish to honour you. The Messenger of Allaah\
    \  (peace \n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ate some of it and told his\
    \ companions \n    to eat too. I said to myself: This is two. Then I came to the\
    \ Messenger of \n    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when\
    \ he was in \n    Baqee’ al-Gharqad, where he had attended the funeral of one\
    \ of his \n    companions and he was wearing two shawls and was sitting among\
    \ his \n    companions. I greeted him with salaam then I moved behind him, trying\
    \ to \n    look at his back to see the Seal that my companion had described to\
    \ me. When \n    the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\
    \ him) saw \n    me going behind him, he realized that I was trying to find confirmation\
    \ of \n    something that had been described to me, so he let his rida’ drop from\
    \ his \n    back, and I saw the Seal and recognized it. Then I embraced him, kissing\
    \ \n    (the Seal) and weeping, and the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and \n   \
    \ blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to me: “Turn around.” So I turned \n \
    \   around and I told him my story as I have told it to you, O Ibn ‘Abbaas. The\
    \ \n    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wanted\
    \ \n    his companions to hear that. Then Salmaan was kept busy with the work\
    \ of a \n    slave, until he had missed attending Badr and Uhud with the Messenger\
    \ of \n    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). He said: Then\
    \ the \n    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said\
    \ to \n    me: “Draw up a contract of manumission, O Salmaan.” So I draw up a\
    \ contract \n    of manumission with my master in return for three hundred palm\
    \ trees which I \n    would plant for him, and forty uqiyahs. The Messenger of\
    \ Allaah  (peace \n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to his companions:\
    \ “Help your \n    brother.” So they helped me with the palm trees, one man gave\
    \ thirty small \n    trees and another gave twenty, and another gave fifteen,\
    \ and another gave \n    ten, i.e., each man gave according to what he had, until\
    \ they had collected \n    three hundred small trees for me. Then the Messenger\
    \ of Allaah  (peace \n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to me: “Go,\
    \ O Salmaan, and dig the \n    holes where they are to be planted. When you have\
    \ finished, come to me and I \n    will plant them with my own hand.” So I dug\
    \ the holes for them, and my \n    companions helped me, then when I had finished,\
    \ I came to him and told him. \n    The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings\
    \ of Allaah be upon him) \n    came out with me and we started to bring the trees\
    \ close and the Messenger \n    of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\
    \ him) planted them with \n    his own hand. By the One in Whose hand is the soul\
    \ of Salmaan, not one \n    single tree among them died. So I had paid off the\
    \ trees but there still \n    remained the money. A piece of gold the size of\
    \ an egg was brought to the \n    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of\
    \ Allaah be upon him) from \n    one of his campaigns. He said: “What happened\
    \ to the Persian who had a \n    contract of manumission?” I was summoned to him\
    \ and he said: “Take this and \n    pay off what you owe, O Salmaan.” I said:\
    \ How could this pay off everything \n    I owe, O Messenger of Allaah? He said:\
    \ “Take it, and Allaah will help you to \n    pay off what you owe.” So I took\
    \ it and weighed it for them, and by the One \n    in Whose hand is the soul of\
    \ Salmaan, it was forty uqiyahs, so I paid them \n    their dues and I was set\
    \ free. I was present with the Messenger of Allaah \n     (peace and blessings\
    \ of Allaah be upon him) at al-Khandaq, and after \n    that I did not miss any\
    \ major event with him. \n\n    Narrated by Ahmad in al-Musnad (5/441). The scholars\
    \ \n    of hadeeth said: Its isnaad is hasan. \n\n    And Allaah knows best."
- source_sentence: How will those who entered Hell then were brought forth from it
    enjoy Paradise?
  sentences:
  - 'Praise be to Allah.Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah believe that some of the Muslims
    will enter Paradise without being brought to account or being punished, and some
    of them will enter Paradise after being brought to account, and some will enter
    Paradise after being punished in Hell as Allah wills, then He will bring them
    forth from it. 

    The fact that these people are brought forth from Hell then admitted to Paradise
    will not cause them any sorrow or distress in Paradise, because Paradise is the
    abode of delight, and they will have whatever the other people of Paradise will
    have, as mentioned in the Quran and Sunnah. 

    There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that these people will feel any kind
    of regret after entering Paradise due to the punishment that they experienced
    in Hell. 

    But the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has told us about how
    these people will be after they are brought forth from Hell. That includes the
    following: 

    1 – They will be thrown into the River of Life, and will grow anew. 

    It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) that
    the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When the people
    of Paradise enter Paradise and the people of Hell enter Hell, Allah will say:
    ‘Whoever had a mustard-seed’s weight of faith in his heart, bring him out.’ So
    they will bring him out, and they will come out like burned skeletons, and they
    will turn into charcoal. They will be thrown into the River of Life, then they
    will grow like seeds growing in the silt left by a flood.”  

    The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do you not see how
    they emerge yellow and curved?” 

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (6192) and Muslim (184). 

    2 – The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stated that they will
    change after they are brought forth from the Fire. 

    It was narrated from Jaabir (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger
    of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said of the Jahannamiyyoon
    (those who had been in Hell) that they “would be brought forth from the Fire after
    having been in it. They will come out as if they are branches of sesame. Then
    they will go into one of the rivers of Paradise, where they will wash themselves,
    then they will emerge like sheets of paper.” 

    Narrated by Muslim (191). 

    Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The word sesame refers to the well-known
    sesame from which sesame oil is extracted. Imam Abu’l-Sa’aadaat al-Mubaarak ibn
    Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Kareem al-Jazari, who is known as Ibn al-Atheer (may Allah
    have mercy on him), said: What it means – and Allah knows best – is that if the
    branches of sesame are gathered and left in the sun so that their seeds may be
    collected, they turn thin and black as if they have been burned, so these people
    are likened to them. 

    “then they will emerge like sheets of paper” They are likened to sheets of paper
    because they will be so white after they wash themselves and all the blackness
    that was on them is removed. 

    Sharh Muslim (3/52). 

    According to a report narrated by al-Bukhaari (6190): 

    It was narrated from Jaabir (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace
    and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “They will emerge from the Fire through
    intercession as if they are small cucumbers.”  

    Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 

    With regard to small cucumbers … What is meant is something that is white and
    small. 

    Note: 

    This likeness refers to how they will be after they grow. But when they first
    emerge from Hell they will be like charcoal as we shall see in the hadeeth below. 

    Fath al-Baari (11/429). 

    3 – They will become like pearls, and Allah will bestow His good pleasure upon
    them, and He will never be angry with them. 

    It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri that the Messenger of Allah (peace and
    blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah will say: ‘The angels have interceded,
    the Prophets have interceded and there is no one left but the Most Merciful of
    those who show mercy.’ Then He will take a handful from Hell, and will bring out
    people who never did any good and who will have turned into charcoal. He will
    throw them into a river on the outskirts of Paradise that is called the River
    of Life, and they will emerge like seeds in the silt carried by a flood. … They
    will emerge like pearls with jewels around their necks, and the people of Paradise
    will recognize them. These are the ones ransomed by Allah, whom Allah admitted
    to Paradise with no good deed that they did or sent on ahead. Then He will say:
    ‘Enter Paradise, and whatever you see is yours.’ They will say: ‘Our Lord, You
    have given us what You have never given to anyone else in creation.’ He will say:
    ‘You will have something better than that with Me.’ They will say, ‘O Lord, what
    could be better than this?’ He will say, ‘My good pleasure, for I will never be
    angry with you again.’” 

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (7002) and Muslim (183). 

    This is an important hadeeth in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah
    be upon him) points out the great status of those who are brought forth from Hell,
    and the honours that their Lord will bestow upon them by His grace and bounty,
    which include: 

    (a)Being thrown in the River of Life, and growing anew.

    (b)Emerging from the river like pearls with jewels around their necks

    (c)Being given everything that they see in Paradise.

    (d)Their thinking, because of the blessings and the ultimate joy they experience,
    that Allah has honoured them with something that He has not bestowed upon anyone
    else.

    (e)He will bestow His pleasure upon them and never be angry with them again.

    The honour that Allah will bestow upon these people who enter Paradise is confirmed
    in the following hadeeth: 

    It was narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood that the Prophet (peace and blessings
    of Allah be upon him) said: “I know the last of the people of Hell to be brought
    forth, and the last of the people of Paradise to enter therein. It will be a man
    who will emerge crawling from Hell, and Allah, may He be blessed and exalted,
    will say to him: ‘Go and enter Paradise.’ He will come to it and it will appear
    to him to be full. He will go back and say, ‘O Lord, I found it full.’  Allah,
    may He be blessed and exalted, will say to him: ‘Go and enter Paradise.’ He will
    go to it and it will appear to him to be full. He will go back and say, ‘O Lord,
    I found it full.’ Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, will say to him: ‘Go and
    enter Paradise, and you will have the equivalent of the whole world and ten times
    as much.’ He will say, ‘Are You mocking me – or laughing at me – when You are
    the Sovereign?’” He said: And I saw the Messenger of Allah (S) smile so broadly
    that his molars appeared. And he said: “That will be the lowest of the people
    of Paradise in status.” 

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (6202) and Muslim (186). 

    4 – They will be known as al-Jahannamiyyoon (the hellish ones) or “ ‘utaqa’ al-Jabbaar”
    (those ransomed by the Compeller, i.e., Allah), then this name will be lifted
    from them. 

    The name al-Jahannamiyyoon is the plural of jahannami, i.e., hellish (of or pertaining
    to Hell), What is meant is that Allah has ransomed them from Hell. 

    It was narrated from Anas ibn Maalik that the Prophet (peace and blessings of
    Allah be upon him) said: “Some people will be brought forth from the Fire after
    its flames touch them (and change their colour), then they will be admitted to
    Paradise, and the people of Paradise will call them al-Jahannamiyyoon.” 

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (6191). 

    Ahmad (12060) narrated from Anas: “… they will enter Paradise and the people of
    Paradise will say: These are al-Jahannamiyyoon.” But al-Jabbaar (the Compeller
    – Allah) will say: ‘No, rather they are the ones ransomed by al-Jabbaar, may He
    be glorified and exalted.’” 

    Classed as saheeh by Ibn Mandah in al-Eemaan (2/847); Ibn Khuzaymah (2/710) and
    al-Albaani in Hukm Taarik al-Salaah (p. 33). 

    Ibn Hibbaan narrated from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri: “… In Paradise they will be called
    al-Jahannamiyyoon, because of the blackness on their faces, and they will say:
    ‘Our Lord, take this name away from us.’ So He will command them to wash themselves
    in a river in Paradise and will take that away from them.” 

    Narrated and classed as saheeh by Ibn Hibbaan (16/457). It was also classed as
    saheeh by Shu’ayb al-Arna’oot. 

    The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has told us that one dip
    in Paradise will cause the Muslim to forget all hardship that he faced in this
    world, so how about if Paradise is to be his eternal abode? It is not farfetched
    to assume that this also includes the hardship that the Muslim faced when he was
    in Hell. 

    It was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings
    of Allah be upon him) said: “The most affluent of the people in this world, of
    those who will go to Hell, will be brought on the Day of Resurrection and dipped
    once in the Fire. Then it will be said: O son of Adam, did you ever see anything
    good? Did you ever have any pleasure? He will say: No, by Allah, O Lord. Then
    the most destitute of the people in this world, of those who will enter Paradise,
    will be brought and dipped once in Paradise, and it will be said to him: O son
    of Adam, did you ever see anything bad? Did you ever experience any hardship?
    He will say: No, by Allah, O Lord. I never saw anything bad and I never experienced
    any hardship.” 

    Narrated by Muslim (2807) 

    Another indication that one dip in the bliss of Paradise will take away all hardship
    that came before it, even the hardship of being punished in Hell, in addition
    to what we have mentioned of their forms being changed after they are thrown into
    the River of Life, is the report narrated by Muslim (2836) from Abu Hurayrah (may
    Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon
    him) who said: “Whoever enters Paradise will enjoy bliss and will not be miserable,
    his clothes will not wear out and his youth will not fade.” 

    This blessing confirms that misery will be erased for the one who enters Paradise,
    and it is general in meaning and includes everyone who enters it, whether they
    entered Hell beforehand or not. 

    Al-Qaadi said: What this means is that Paradise is the abode of stability and
    blessing which will not change or be disturbed by any hardship or corruption.
    Quoted in Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi (7/194). 

    For all of these reasons, Allah tells us about the condition of the people of
    Paradise when they enter it: 

    “And they will say: ‘All the praises and thanks be to Allah Who has removed from
    us (all) grief. Verily, our Lord is indeed Oft‑Forgiving, Most Ready to appreciate
    (good deeds and to recompense).

    35. Who, out of His Grace, has lodged us in a home that will last forever, where
    toil will touch us not nor weariness will touch us’”

    [Faatir 35:34-35]

    Shaykh al-Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: i.e., the home of eternal
    abode, the home where one will want to stay forever, because of the many good
    things therein, and because of the ongoing delight and because there is nothing
    to disturb this pleasure. 

    That is “out of His Grace” towards us and His Bounty, not because of our deeds.
    Were it not for His Grace, we would not have reached the point we have reached. 

    “where toil will touch us not nor weariness will touch us” i.e., there will be
    no tiredness in body, heart or strength, or because of an abundance of pleasures.
    This indicates that Allah will make their bodies physically perfect and will create
    all means of making their abode there one of continuous delight and pleasure,
    so that they will not be touched by toil or weariness, or by worry or sorrow.

  - "Praise be to Allah.\n    Fitting false teeth to replace teeth that have been\
    \ taken out \n    because they were unhealthy or damaged is something permissible\
    \ and there is \n    nothing wrong with doing it, and we do not know of any scholar\
    \ who disallows \n    it. It makes no difference whether the teeth are fixed in\
    \ place in the mouth \n    or not. The patient should do what is best for him\
    \ in consultation with a \n    specialist in that field. \n\n    Changing the\
    \ creation of Allaah means not accepting the \n    creation of Allaah with regard\
    \ to the length or shape of the teeth or the \n    gaps between them. Hence the\
    \ one who changes the creation of Allaah in \n    general is cursed, and the one\
    \ who changes it with regard to his teeth in \n    particular is cursed.  \n\n\
    \    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n    “They (all those who\
    \ worship others than Allaah) invoke \n    nothing but female deities besides\
    \ Him (Allaah), and they invoke nothing but \n    Shaytaan (Satan), a persistent\
    \ rebel!\n\n    118. Allaah cursed him. And he [Shaytaan (Satan)] said: ‘I \n\
    \    will take an appointed portion of your slaves.\n\n    119. ‘Verily, I will\
    \ mislead them, and surely, I will \n    arouse in them false desires; and certainly,\
    \ I will order them to slit the \n    ears of cattle, and indeed I will order\
    \ them to change the nature created by \n    Allaah.’ And whoever takes Shaytaan\
    \ (Satan) as a Wali (protector or helper) \n    instead of Allaah, has surely,\
    \ suffered a manifest loss”\n\n    [al-Nisa’ 4:117-119]\n\n    It was narrated\
    \ from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be \n    pleased with him) that the\
    \ Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) said: “May Allaah\
    \ curse the one who does tattoos and the one who \n    has a tattoo done, the\
    \ one who plucks eyebrows and the one who has her \n    eyebrows plucked, and\
    \ those who file teeth for the purpose of \n    beautification, changing the creation\
    \ of Allaah.” Narrated by Muslim \n    (2125). \n\n    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have\
    \ mercy on him) said: \n\n    The one who does tattoos is the one who uses a needle\
    \ and the \n    like on the back of the hand, wrist, temple or other place on\
    \ a woman’s body \n    where blood flows, then fills that place with kohl etc\
    \ and it turns blue.  \n\n    “The one who plucks eyebrows” is one who removes\
    \ hair from \n    the face. \n\n    “Those who file teeth” refers to women who\
    \ file the teeth to \n    create a gap between the front teeth and second incisors.\
    \ This was done by \n    elderly women and those of similar age to make them look\
    \ younger and to make \n    the teeth look more beautiful, because it is younger\
    \ girls who have these \n    nice gaps between their teeth. When a woman grows\
    \ older her teeth become \n    bigger, so they used to file them to make them\
    \ look nicer and to make people \n    think they were younger. This action is\
    \ haraam for the one who does it and \n    the one to whom it is done, because\
    \ of these ahaadeeth, and because it is \n    changing the creation of Allaah,\
    \ and because it is cheating and deceiving \n    people. \n\n    “Those who file\
    \ teeth for the purpose of beautification” – \n    this indicates that what is\
    \ haraam is that which is done for the purpose of \n    beautification. But if\
    \ it is needed for medical reasons or to correct a \n    fault in the tooth and\
    \ so on, then there is nothing wrong with it. \n\n    Sharh Muslim (14/106, 107). \n\
    \n    The words of al-Nawawi point to the difference between \n    treating the\
    \ teeth in order to remove a fault in them and not being pleased \n    with the\
    \ creation of Allaah and tinkering with it for the purpose of \n    beautification.\
    \ The former is permissible and the latter is haraam. \n\n    There is evidence\
    \ in the Sunnah which shows that it is \n    permissible to wear false teeth if\
    \ the teeth have fallen out due to old age \n    or sickness, and it is permissible\
    \ for them to be made of gold if nothing \n    else can be used. \n\n    It was\
    \ narrated from ‘Arfajah  ibn As’ad that his nose was \n    cut off at the battle\
    \ of Kilaab during the Jaahiliyyah, and he wore a nose \n    of silver, but it\
    \ caused a foul stench, so the Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be\
    \ upon him) told him to wear a nose made of gold.  \n\n    Narrated by al-Tirmidhi\
    \ (1770), Abu Dawood (4232) and \n    al-Nasaa’i (5161). Classed as hasan by Shaykh\
    \ al-Albaani in Irwa’ \n    al-Ghaleel (824). \n\n    The scholars of the Standing\
    \ Committee said: \n\n    But in cases of necessity it is permissible to use gold\
    \ for \n    teeth, noses and the like, if nothing else can be used instead. End\
    \ quote. \n\n    Fataawa Islamiyyah (4/248). \n\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih\
    \ al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have \n    mercy on him) said:  \n\n    We should\
    \ note that it is not permissible to have a gold \n    tooth except when there\
    \ is a need for that. It is not permissible for anyone \n    to have a gold tooth\
    \ put in for the purpose of adornment, except women for \n    whom is it customary\
    \ to have gold teeth, in which case there is nothing \n    wrong with it. But\
    \ for men it is not permissible at all except in cases of \n    necessity. End\

    \    And Allaah knows best."
  - 'Praise be to Allah.Everything from when Allaah created the Pen until the Day
    of Resurrection is written in al-Lawh al-Mahfooz, because when Allaah first created
    the Pen, He said to it: “Write.” It said: “My Lord, what should I write?” He said:
    “Write what is to be. So at that moment it began to write what would be until
    the Day of Resurrection. And it is proven from the Prophet (peace and blessings
    of Allaah be upon him) that when the foetus in its mother’s womb is four months
    old, Allaah sends an angel to breathe the soul into it and write down its provision,
    its lifespan and its deeds, and whether it is doomed or blessed.  

    Provision is also written down and connected to its means, and it does not increase
    or decrease. Among those means are that man should work to seek provision, as
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):

    “He it is Who has made the earth subservient to you (i.e. easy for you to walk,
    to live and to do agriculture on it); so walk in the path thereof and eat of His
    provision. And to Him will be the Resurrection” [al-Mulk 67:15]

    Other means are:  

    upholding ties of kinship, such as honouring one’s parents and upholding ties
    with relatives. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
    “Whoever would like his provision to be abundant and his lifespan to be extended,
    let him uphold his ties of kinship.” 

    Fearing Allaah (taqwa), as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):

    “And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for
    him to get out (from every difficulty).

    3. And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever
    puts his trust in Allaah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allaah will accomplish
    his purpose. Indeed Allaah has set a measure for all things” [al-Talaaq 65:2-3]

    Do not say “Provision is foreordained and limited and I will not do any of the
    things that lead to it,” because this is helplessness; smartness and resolve mean
    striving to seek provision and that which will benefit you in religious and worldly
    terms. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The smart
    man is the one who takes stock of himself and strives to do that which will benefit
    him after death, and the helpless one is the one who follows his own whims and
    desires and engages in wishful thinking, (assuming that Allaah will forgive him
    regardless of what he does and that he does not need to strive to good deeds).” 

    Just as provision is written and connected to its means, so too marriage is also
    written and preordained. For both spouses it is written that he or she will be
    the spouse of this particular person. Nothing is hidden from Allaah on earth or
    in heaven. End quote. 

    And Allaah knows best. 

    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him)'
- source_sentence: Which is better, reading Qur’aan together or individually?
  sentences:
  - "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly: \n\n    With regard to your father, you have\
    \ to keep on advising him \n    and reminding him of what Allaah has enjoined\
    \ upon him with regard to \n    himself and to his family. \n\n    You have to\
    \ try different methods of advising him. It may be \n    hard for him to hear\
    \ it from you, but do not despair of reminders and \n    exhortations reaching\
    \ him by way of your relatives or his friends. You could \n    also let him listen\
    \ to some useful tapes. \n\n    Secondly: \n\n    You have to fear Allaah with\
    \ regard to your husband. You \n    should not bring the worries of your family\
    \ into your husband’s house and \n    place them on his shoulders, especially\
    \ since he treats you well and you do \n    not see anything from him that upsets\
    \ you. What you have to do is to \n    appreciate him and treat him kindly. This\
    \ is what Allaah commands you to \n    do. \n\n    Thirdly: \n\n    No one is\
    \ free of diseases – except those on whom Allaah has \n    mercy. The fact that\
    \ your father likes to show off and to appear to be \n    better than others means\
    \ that you have to be compassionate towards him, not \n    resent him. The fact\
    \ that he has treated you badly and is still doing so \n    means that you should\
    \ show mercy towards him, for if he dies and meets his \n    Lord in that state,\
    \ then he will meet Him with many sins. \n\n    Hence you and your siblings and\
    \ family have to look again at \n    your relationship with your father and your\
    \ attitude towards him, for Allaah \n    has commanded us to treat parents well\
    \ and honour them, even if they call us \n    to shirk and kufr. Allaah says (interpretation\
    \ of the meaning): \n\n    “But if they (both) strive with you to make you join\
    \ in \n    worship with Me others that of which you have no knowledge, then obey\
    \ them \n    not; but behave with them in the world kindly, and follow the path\
    \ of him \n    who turns to Me in repentance and in obedience. Then to Me will\
    \ be your \n    return, and I shall tell you what you used to do”\n\n    [Luqmaan\
    \ 31:15]\nIbraaheem (peace be upon \n    him) debated with his mushrik father\
    \ politely, as Allaah tells us \n    (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n   \
    \ “And mention in the Book (the Qur’aan) Ibraaheem \n    (Abraham). Verily, he\
    \ was a man of truth, a Prophet.\n\n    42. When he said to his father: ‘O my\
    \ father! Why do you \n    worship that which hears not, sees not and cannot avail\
    \ you in anything?\n\n    43. ‘O my father! Verily, there has come to me of the\
    \ \n    knowledge that which came not unto you. So follow me, I will guide you\
    \ to \n    the Straight Path.\n\n    44. ‘O my father! Worship not Shaytaan (Satan).\
    \ Verily, \n    Shaytaan (Satan) has been a rebel against the Most Gracious (Allaah).\n\
    \n    45. ‘O my father! Verily, I fear lest a torment from the \n    Most Gracious\
    \ (Allaah) should overtake you, so that you become a companion \n    of Shaytaan\
    \ (Satan) (in the Hell-fire).’ \n\n    46. He (the father) said: ‘Do you reject\
    \ my gods, O \n    Ibraaheem (Abraham)? If you stop not (this), I will indeed\
    \ stone you. So get \n    away from me safely (before I punish you).’\n\n    47. Ibraaheem\
    \ (Abraham) said: ‘Peace be on you! I will ask \n    forgiveness of my Lord for\
    \ you. Verily, He is unto me Ever Most Gracious’”\n\n    [Maryam 19:41-47]\n\n\
    \    Look at the etiquette of this Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah\
    \ be upon him) and how he addressed his mushrik father who \n    was threatening\
    \ his Muslim son. In this there is a great lesson for those \n    who suffer a\
    \ similar problem with their fathers. \n\n    Fourthly: \n\n    With regard to\
    \ the grief that you feel, it should not make \n    you stop doing things or prevent\
    \ you from doing acts of worship, or make you \n    fall short in doing that which\
    \ Allaah has enjoined upon you, such as the \n    duties that Allaah has enjoined\
    \ upon you towards your husband, or the duty \n    to call your father to Allaah. \n\
    \n    We advise you to recite a du’aa’ for protection, and another \n    for healing. \n\
    \n    The du’aa’ for protection is as follows: \n\n    It was narrated from Anas\
    \ (may Allaah be pleased with him) \n    that the Prophet  (peace and blessings\
    \ of Allaah be upon him) used to \n    say: “Allaahumma inni a’oodhu bika min\
    \ al-hammi wa’l-hazani wa’l’ajzi \n    wa’l-kasali wa’l-jubni wa’l-bukhli wa dala’\
    \ il-dayn wa ghalbat al-rijaal \n    (O Allaah, I seek refuge with You from worry,\
    \ grief, incapacity, laziness, \n    cowardice, miserliness, from being heavily\
    \ indebt \n    and from being overcome by men).” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6008.\
    \  \n\n    The du’aa’ for healing is as follows: \n\n    It was narrated that\
    \ ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood said: The \n    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings\
    \ of Allaah be upon him) said: \n    “If a person who is afflicted by anxiety\
    \ or sorrow says: ‘Allaahumma inni \n    ‘abduka wa ibnu ‘abdika wa ibn ammatika\
    \ naasiyati bi yadika maadin fiyya \n    hukmuka ‘adlun fiyya qadaa’uka as’aluka\

    \   And Allaah knows best."
  - "Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah \n    have mercy\
    \ on him) said: \nFirstly: \nWith regard to how he reviewed it with him, I \n\
    \    do not know how that was done. \nSecondly: \nWith regard to whether it is\
    \ mustahabb for \n    people to gather to read Qur’aan together or for each person\
    \ to read it individually, that depends on the person himself. If gathering with\
    \ his \n    brothers to study Qur’aan together will make him more focused and\
    \ help him to learn better, then gathering with others is preferable, i.e., if\
    \ \n    gathering with others will make him have proper presence of mind and be\
    \ more focused on pondering the meanings of the Qur’aan, and allow the \n    opportunity\
    \ to discuss the meanings, then that is better. But if it is the opposite then\
    \ reading it on his own is better. \nThirdly: \nWith regard to Jibreel reviewing\
    \ the Qur’aan \n    with the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him),\
    \ that was for the purpose of making sure that the Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings\
    \ of Allaah be upon him) memorized it.  \nWith regard to the third part of your\
    \ \n    question – which is whether it is better to do that at night rather than\
    \ during the day – the answer is yes, but a person may need to do other \n   \
    \ things which means that he cannot study Qur’aan at night, in which case he should\
    \ study it more during the day. \nSo each person should look at what is best for\
    \ him, because of the general meaning of the \n    words of the Prophet  (peace\
    \ and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Strive to do that which will benefit\
    \ you.” So whatever is more beneficial \n    for you, so long as it is not forbidden\
    \ according to sharee’ah, is best."
  - 'Praise be to Allah.Firstly:

    Families are not without problems, some of which are easy to resolve and some
    of which are difficult. One who wants to solve his own problems or the problems
    of someone else must understand the causes that led to those differences and conflict
    and resentment, whether it is between spouses, between friends, or between father
    and son, or any parties to a conflict.

    We do not know the cause of the differences between you and your wife, so we can
    only offer general advice that may be suitable for you and for others.

    You should look for the cause of those differences between you and your wife.
    You may be the main cause, or a large part of the cause, because of something
    in your nature that you cannot change, or because of poor treatment on your part
    of your wife, or because you pay little attention to her and your children, or
    for any other out of many possible reasons. So you must correct your mistakes,
    and put an end to those differences by putting an end to their causes, if the
    problem is on your side. You cannot be unaware that kind treatment of your wife,
    showing her compassion, praising her for what she does, and taking good care of
    the children, whilst striving to bring what the household needs, will all make
    a wife pleased with her husband, which will create love between the spouses and
    spread compassion in the household.

    But if the causes of the problems and differences between you stem from the wife,
    then you must also deal with this matter with wisdom and kindly exhortation. The
    easiest thing for the husband – in principle and in most cases – is to win his
    wife over and make her love what she hates, and hate what she loves, because when
    a wife is pleased with a man as her husband, she will be content to live according
    to his wishes and interests, and she does not necessarily have to love that and
    be pleased with it. This is the nature of wives in general; hence a woman follows
    her husband. Therefore it is prohibited for a Muslim woman to marry a disbeliever.
    This is also the reason why it is advised to make a good choice of husband, and
    to choose one who is of good character and religiously committed, lest the woman
    be negatively affected by his lack of religious commitment and character.

    Secondly:

    It may be that a husband is not compatible with his wife, so he will not be able
    to improve the way he deals with her, and she will not be able to fulfil the permissible
    desires of her husband. In that case it is better for them to separate, because
    their staying together will be a waste of time and will cause a great deal of
    problems and distress.

    Based on what is mentioned in the question, we say: if the husband does not think
    that his wife is not willing to change her attitude towards him, and he is not
    the cause of these problems, then he has no choice but to divorce her, taking
    the last option for remedying the situation. It is not required that the wife
    should accept this as a solution, because her approval is not a factor in the
    case of divorce. We are only saying that the solution for these problems is divorce
    for several reasons, based on your question:


    It is not possible that your wife will change her attitude and manners, because
    the problems between you have been going on for a long time.

    You are not able to take another wife, because of your environment.

    The fear that you may fall into haraam because she does not fulfil your sexual
    desires.


    So give her one last chance, and set a deadline for her to change her attitude.
    then if there is no change on her part, do not hesitate to issue a divorce, and
    beware of falling into haraam, for according to the laws of Allah you are muhsan
    (married or previously-married), and the hadd punishment is stoning if you fall
    into haraam – Allah forbid. There are many warnings in Islam for the one who transgresses
    the sacred rights of others and the one who commits the shameful deeds that Allah
    has forbidden, so be very, very careful.

    'Which is better, reading Qur’aan together or individually?',
    'Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah \n    have mercy on him) said:\xa0\nFirstly:\xa0\nWith regard to how he reviewed it with him, I \n    do not know how that was done.\xa0\nSecondly:\xa0\nWith regard to whether it is mustahabb for \n    people to gather to read Qur’aan together or for each person to read it individually, that depends on the person himself. If gathering with his \n    brothers to study Qur’aan together will make him more focused and help him to learn better, then gathering with others is preferable, i.e., if \n    gathering with others will make him have proper presence of mind and be more focused on pondering the meanings of the Qur’aan, and allow the \n    opportunity to discuss the meanings, then that is better. But if it is the opposite then reading it on his own is better.\xa0\nThirdly:\xa0\nWith regard to Jibreel reviewing the Qur’aan \n    with the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), that was for the purpose of making sure that the Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) memorized it. \xa0\nWith regard to the third part of your \n    question – which is whether it is better to do that at night rather than during the day – the answer is yes, but a person may need to do other \n    things which means that he cannot study Qur’aan at night, in which case he should study it more during the day.\xa0\nSo each person should look at what is best for him, because of the general meaning of the \n    words of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Strive to do that which will benefit you.” So whatever is more beneficial \n    for you, so long as it is not forbidden according to sharee’ah, is best.',
    'Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nFamilies are not without problems, some of which are easy to resolve and some of which are difficult. One who wants to solve his own problems or the problems of someone else must understand the causes that led to those differences and conflict and resentment, whether it is between spouses, between friends, or between father and son, or any parties to a conflict.\nWe do not know the cause of the differences between you and your wife, so we can only offer general advice that may be suitable for you and for others.\nYou should look for the cause of those differences between you and your wife. You may be the main cause, or a large part of the cause, because of something in your nature that you cannot change, or because of poor treatment on your part of your wife, or because you pay little attention to her and your children, or for any other out of many possible reasons. So you must correct your mistakes, and put an end to those differences by putting an end to their causes, if the problem is on your side. You cannot be unaware that kind treatment of your wife, showing her compassion, praising her for what she does, and taking good care of the children, whilst striving to bring what the household needs, will all make a wife pleased with her husband, which will create love between the spouses and spread compassion in the household.\nBut if the causes of the problems and differences between you stem from the wife, then you must also deal with this matter with wisdom and kindly exhortation. The easiest thing for the husband – in principle and in most cases – is to win his wife over and make her love what she hates, and hate what she loves, because when a wife is pleased with a man as her husband, she will be content to live according to his wishes and interests, and she does not necessarily have to love that and be pleased with it. This is the nature of wives in general; hence a woman follows her husband. Therefore it is prohibited for a Muslim woman to marry a disbeliever. This is also the reason why it is advised to make a good choice of husband, and to choose one who is of good character and religiously committed, lest the woman be negatively affected by his lack of religious commitment and character.\nSecondly:\nIt may be that a husband is not compatible with his wife, so he will not be able to improve the way he deals with her, and she will not be able to fulfil the permissible desires of her husband. In that case it is better for them to separate, because their staying together will be a waste of time and will cause a great deal of problems and distress.\nBased on what is mentioned in the question, we say: if the husband does not think that his wife is not willing to change her attitude towards him, and he is not the cause of these problems, then he has no choice but to divorce her, taking the last option for remedying the situation. It is not required that the wife should accept this as a solution, because her approval is not a factor in the case of divorce. We are only saying that the solution for these problems is divorce for several reasons, based on your question:\n\nIt is not possible that your wife will change her attitude and manners, because the problems between you have been going on for a long time.\nYou are not able to take another wife, because of your environment.\nThe fear that you may fall into haraam because she does not fulfil your sexual desires.\n\nSo give her one last chance, and set a deadline for her to change her attitude. then if there is no change on her part, do not hesitate to issue a divorce, and beware of falling into haraam, for according to the laws of Allah you are muhsan (married or previously-married), and the hadd punishment is stoning if you fall into haraam – Allah forbid. There are many warnings in Islam for the one who transgresses the sacred rights of others and the one who commits the shameful deeds that Allah has forbidden, so be very, very careful.\nAnd Allah is the source of strength.',
